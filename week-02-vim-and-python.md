# 📝 Week 3: Vim Adventures & My First Steps in Python

This week felt like a turning point — I’m still sharpening my Vim skills, but I also took my first proper steps into Python.  
It’s exciting and a little overwhelming, but in the best way.

## 🎮 Leveling Up in Vim

I played through **Vim Adventures**, beating levels 1 and 2. It’s basically a game, but it tricks your brain into remembering motions and commands through repetition.  

Vim motions still feel a bit daunting — they’re like learning a new language inside an already new language. But every small “Aha!” moment builds my confidence.  

Next experiment:  
Running Vim inside **VSCode** and **PyCharm** so I can merge my coding environment with my editing workflow. That way, I get the best of both worlds — IDE features + Vim efficiency.

## 🐍 Enter Python

Alongside Vim, I finally cracked open Python.  
Starting simple, but each concept feels like a puzzle piece I can already imagine using in real projects.

### Topics I’ve tackled so far:
- **Strings, Numbers, and Data Types** → Understanding how Python sees and stores data  
- **Variables** → Giving names to values so they can be reused and changed  
- **Functions** → Encapsulating logic so I can reuse code without rewriting it

Even at this early stage, I’m seeing why Python is loved — it’s clean, readable, and doesn’t make you fight the syntax.

## 💡 Reflections

- Learning two skills in parallel (Vim + Python) feels ambitious, but they complement each other.
- Vim teaches me to think *precisely* about how I interact with code.
- Python is showing me how to think *logically* about solving problems.

It’s like sharpening two blades at once — one for **how** I write code, and one for **what** that code does.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Finish level 3 of Vim Adventures
- Practice Vim motions until they feel natural
- Write small Python scripts to reinforce variables and functions
- Start exploring conditionals in Python

> 📌 Note to self: Don’t just “learn” commands or syntax — use them until they feel like instinct.
