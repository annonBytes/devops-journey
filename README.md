🚀 Documenting my journey from Product Design to DevOps. Starting with Linux, building a homelab, and learning in public — one week at a time.


# 🧰 My DevOps Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Daniel — a Product Designer and PM making the leap into the world of DevOps.

This repo is my learning journal — from Linux basics to building infrastructure, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and exploring the cloud. I'm starting with a self-hosted **Ubuntu homelab**, learning everything hands-on and sharing my progress along the way.
